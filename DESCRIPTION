Description: Studies of resilience in older adults employ a single-arm design where everyone experiences the stressor. The simplistic approach of regressing change versus baseline yields biased estimates due to regression-to-the-mean. This package provides a method to correct the bias. It also allows covariates to be included. The method implemented in the package is described in Varadhan, R., Zhu, J., and Bandeen-Roche, K (2023), Biostatistics (To appear).
